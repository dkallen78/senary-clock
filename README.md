## Senary Clock!

This is the clock no one asked for!

### What is Senary?

Senary is a base-6 number system, also known as heximal or seximal. 

### Why Senary?

Because clocks run on the numbers 60, 24, and 12, and 6 is a factor of all of those. I thought I'd make a 24-hour clock that used the base-6 number system. It was also a really good excuse to make a clock program!

## Updates

### 2020.07.23

I made the thing! Then I made it a bit better by making it glow and giving it some flicker. I don't know what's next. Someone said an alarm...

So I think I'm going to try and do it in SVG, it's more interactive and I don't know how to use it.
