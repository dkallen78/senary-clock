## [Senary Clock!](https://dkallen78.github.io/senary-clock/senaryClock.html)

This is the clock no one asked for!

### What is Senary?

Senary is a base-6 number system, also known as heximal or seximal. 

### Why Senary?

Because clocks run on the numbers 60, 24, and 12, and 6 is a factor of all of those. I thought I'd make a 24-hour clock that used the base-6 number system. It was also a really good excuse to make a clock program!

### How to Read Senary Numbers?

The numbers we're used to are in base-10, that is, every digit of our number has nine possible numbers: 0 - 9. The position of the digits determines its value. In a base-10 (decimal) system the furthest right digit is multiplied by 10⁰ to determine its value. The digit to the left of that is multiplied by 10¹, the next by 10² and so on. So the decimal number **234** is equal to (**2** × 10²) + (**3** × 10¹) + (**4** × 10⁰) → (**2** × 100) + (**3** × 10) + (**4** × 1) → 200 + 30 + 4 → 234. 

In a senary system there are only 6 possible digits for our place values: 0 - 6. In this system the far right digit is multiplied by 6⁰ to determine its value. The next digits are determined by multiplying them by 6¹, 6², and so on. So to determine the value of the senary number 234 we apply the same process as we did with the decimal numbers, only now multiplying by powers of 6. **234** is equal to (**2** × 6²) + (**3** × 6¹) + (**4** × 6⁰) → (**2** × 36) + (**3** × 6) + (**4** × 1) → 72 + 18 + 4 → 94.  

## Updates

### 2020.07.23

I made the thing! Then I made it a bit better by making it glow and giving it some flicker. I don't know what's next. Someone said an alarm...

So I think I'm going to try and do it in SVG, it's more interactive and I don't know how to use it.
